/// Abstractions for Kdeps API Server Responses
///
/// This module provides the structure for handling API server responses in the Kdeps system.
/// It includes classes and variables for managing both successful and error responses, as well as
/// any files returned by the server. It also defines how data blocks and error blocks are structured
/// in the API responses.
///
/// This module is part of the `kdeps` schema and interacts with the API server to process responses.
///
/// The module defines:
/// - [APIServerResponseBlock]: For handling data returned in a successful response.
/// - [APIServerErrorsBlock]: For managing error information in a failed API request.
/// - [success]: A flag indicating the success or failure of the API request.
/// - [file]: A URI pointing to any file returned by the server in the response.
/// - [errors]: The error block containing details of the error if the request was unsuccessful.
