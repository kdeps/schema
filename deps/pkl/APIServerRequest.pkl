/// Abstractions for Kdeps API Server Requests
///
/// This module provides functionality to handle and validate HTTP requests to the Kdeps API Server, including methods
/// for parsing HTTP methods, request data, parameters, headers, and file uploads.
///
/// Supported features:
/// - Validation of HTTP methods.
/// - Handling request body data, parameters, headers, and file uploads.
/// - Functions to decode Base64 encoded request data.
/// - File management utilities like retrieving file types and paths.
/// - Filtering files by MIME type.
